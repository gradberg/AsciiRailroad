# AsciiRailroad
Capture the feel of operating a train, picking up cars, rearranging cars, and delivering cars to destinations, all while managing available track space and avoiding other trains. Run a Steam Locomotive, trying to maximize the power and fuel efficiency out of it, all while trying to make careful stops and starts to get your contracts fulfilled.

## Gameplay
Player represents the engineer, who both operates the locomotive and is the owner of the train line's company. As owner, the player chooses when to upgrade locomotives, what deliveries to take. As engineer, the player runs the locomotive's controls, controling the throttle, braking, and other special functions in the case of older engines.

## Roguelike
* Permadeath - You are running a company. If you run out of cash, you're bankrupt and its all over. If you crash the train, the combined cost of replacing the locomotive and paying the injured parties for their lost rolling stock and cargo likely will put you out of business.
* Progression
  * _Improve your locomotives_ - Older locomotives and tenders carry little water and fuel, and have little pulling power. Upgrading to newer ones increases your efficiency and range.
  * _Rolling-Stock_ - At the start of the game, the player only owns the engine and tender, and can only take missions that provide their own rolling stock. Across maps, players can acquire their own cars that they keep with them, allowing them to do additional missions that expect cars to be provided.
  * _Hire Crew_ - At the start, you are a one-man-crew-and-company. Sort of a independent trucker as now. You can hire various crew to assist you:
    * _Brakeman_ can run up and down the train, working the brakes, and jump off the train to throw switches.
    * _Coal Shoveler_ would be tasked with keeping the fire appropriately full at all times.
    * _Engineer_ can take over the duties of actually operating the locomotive itself, taking overall orders from the Player. This is more of a convenience if the player wants to stop running the locomotive themselves. If the player decides to double- or triple-head the train, he'll need at least an Engineer for each.
    * _Lawyer_ increases the chance of winning litigation (stolen cars and cargo, damaged cargo, killed people) or at least reducing their damages.
    
## Arcade Streamlining
I feel the simulation of the steam locomotive is a central aspect of this game giving the player the feeling of running a train from that era. However, it will probably become tedious to do. Therefore missions and maps need to be implemented such that all other aspects are streamlined as far as possible (like how arcade games try to maximize play for that 1-3 minute time span) so that the player does not get bogged down or bored with all the steps necessary.
